# wavefield_modeling
This repository contains implementations of wave propagation modeling with finite-difference methods in the time and frequency domain.

The folder acoustic_frequency_domain_finite_difference folder contains the frequency domain implementation.\
The result is shown below for the frequency of 10Hz:\
